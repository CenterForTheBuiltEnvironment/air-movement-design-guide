# Ceiling Fan System

This section indicates  the criteria when installing ceiling fan 

## Selecting Fan Sizes and Determining the Layout
Determining appropriate fan size and layout is critical to effective cooling from ceiling fans. The highest
air speeds - and therefore the greatest cooling effects - from a ceiling fan are felt directly beneath the fan
and dissipate the farther an occupant is from the fan. Air movement and the associated cooling effect are
also impacted by obstructions such as furniture, partitions, or equipment. Any permanent obstructions
should be considered in determining fan layouts, but spaces that may change in layout over time should
take this into account for that particular application.

Considerations should also include the overall design intent for the ceiling fan application, including the
desired air speed uniformity, and overall coverage of the space. Spaces that are likely to benefit from
more uniformity will require larger fans or more fans than spaces that are likely to benefit from variability
(see the Applications section below for recommended guidelines). Fan size and layout must also consider
relevant code requirements (see Codes and Standards section below), and potential conflicts and spacing
requirements from other building systems such as fire sprinklers and lighting equipment.

To maximize uniformity of air speeds in a space with standard ceiling fans, choose the largest possible fan
that fits in the space while maintaining appropriate mounting height, and clearances from walls and other
obstructions (see Fan Mounting Height and Clearances, below). For small, roughly square rooms such as
residential spaces or private offices, where only one fan is required, a simple rule of thumb is that the fan
diameter should be between 0.2 and 0.4 times the characteristic room width, as shown in Figure 26. For
spaces with a single fan, as closely as possible given practical considerations, the fan should be centered
in room to maximize air speed uniformity. Generally, a single fan centered in a space can effectively serve
a rectangular space with an aspect ratio (length/width) of up to 1.5:1. Rectangular spaces with higher
aspect ratios, or other unconventional shapes, benefit from multiple fans to ensure relatively uniform air
speeds throughout the space. For rectangular (and other unconventional shapes), the characteristic width
of the room is the square root of the floor area. For example, for an 18 ft x 25ft rectangular room, the
characteristic width is 21 ft, and using the simple rule of thumb above yields fan diameters between 4.3
and 8.5 ft.

For spaces requiring multiple fans the overall layout should be determined by subdividing the space into
multiple equal roughly square “fan cells”, and then centering a ceiling fan in each cell, as shown in Figure
27 below. Fan cell size is determined largely by the overall dimensions of the space, and the preferred
size of ceiling fans to be used. In many cases there may be a variety of options for fan cell and fan
diameter. Fewer large fan cells will require larger diameter fans, while a larger number of smaller fan cells
will require smaller diameter fans. When all fans operate at the same speed, the individual fan cells within
larger spaces will behave much like smaller spaces with a single fan, and as such should target an aspect
ratio of no more than 1.5:1. Ratio’s above this value, it is likely possible and beneficial to create split this
cell into two fan smaller cells with smaller aspect ratios. As with smaller single-fan spaces, fan diameters
should be at least in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 times the characteristic width of the fan cell. Higher values
will increase the uniformity of air speeds throughout the space. Fan-to-fan spacing should be determined
based on centering the fan as much as possible within each fan cell, and should take into consideration
needs for air speed uniformity in the space. Spaces with high uniformity requirements may necessitate
larger fans and closer fan spacing.

Large spaces with high ceilings (at least 11 ft) should also consider large-diameter ceiling fans to maximize
air flow and uniformity of air speeds (both horizontally, and vertically).

Another resource for determining optimal fan diameters and layouts is the CBE Ceiling Fan Design Tool,
which allows users to specify the dimensions of a space and details of fan types to determine ideal
layouts. More details on the tool are provided in the CBE Ceiling Fan Design Tool section below.

## Fan Mounting Height and Clearances
Another key consideration for ceiling fan effectiveness is mounting height and clearances. Mounting
heights and clearances from walls and other obstructions are determined based on both safety and
performance considerations.

Standard ceiling fans must be mounted at least seven feet above the floor to prevent any accidental
contact with blades. In addition, industry standards recommend fan blades be at least eight inches below
the ceiling, though clearances of 12 inches or more are more optimal at providing air circulation into the
swept area of the blades and avoiding ‘starving’ the fan. The distance between blades and the ceiling at
which ‘starvation’ occurs increases with fan diameter. An approximation for this has the distance
between the blade and the ceiling should be at least 0.2 times the fan diameter. For spaces with relatively
low ceilings, “hugger” ceiling fans (see Fan Types section) are available without downrods to maintain
adequate clearance, though these fans typically have poorer energy performance than standard fans
mounted at an appropriate distance from the ceiling. In spaces with higher ceilings, standard ceiling fans
should be suspended on downrods at eight to ten feet above the floor to adequately cool occupants. In
addition, standard ceiling fans must be located so that the sweep of the blades is at least 18 inches from
any vertical obstructions such as walls or columns, though clearances of two to three feet are often
recommended to enable proper air circulation.

**A figure 28 Minimum clearances for standard ceiling fans**

Safety regulations require almost all large-diameter fans (above seven feet in diameter, see Fan Types
section) to be mounted such that the blades are at least 10 feet above the floor. A small number of largediameter ceiling fan models can be mounted below 10 feet, but these fan models have limited rotational
speeds to comply with safety regulations, and as such provide limited maximum airflows. As mentioned
above, large-diameter ceiling fans typically require a minimum distance from the ceiling of 0.2 times the
fan diameter, though manufacturer recommendations may vary. Similarly, large diameter fans typically
require at least three feet of clearance from any obstructions to the sides or below the fan blades for
safety and the ensure proper air flow around the fan blades.

**A figure 27 Minimum clearances for large diameter ceiling fans**

In addition to distances from ceilings, floors, and walls, fan placement must also consider any other
obstructions in a space, including lighting, mechanical equipment and ducts, fire sprinkler systems,
warehouse storage racks, as well as any relevant code requirements (see Codes and Standards section
below). For example, when planning an installation of large-diameter ceiling fans in a warehouse, fans
should be mounted at least three feet above the highest level of any storage racks, stored items, and the
tallest extent of any other equipment that may be used in the space such as forklifts. Fan placement and
mounting height should also take into consideration any potential furniture placements, even though
they may not be permanent. Cabinets or tall bookcases may interfere with fan operation, or cause safety
hazards if located too close to ceiling fans.

## Uniformity of Air Speeds
The amount of variation of the air speeds in a space is an important design consideration. Figure 23
below shows the measured air speeds in a cross section through an 18 ft x 18 ft room with a 5 ft diameter
ceiling fan located at the center of the room. The airflow ‘jet’ from the fan immediately narrows to a
slightly smaller diameter than the fan blades. The jet then impinges on the floor, creating a stagnation
point, and then spreads radially outwards along the floor. Smaller diameter fans have a relatively shallow
spreading zone. For the case shown below, the airspeeds in the spreading zone are still high along the
floor at a distance of one fan diameter from the fan center. However, the air speeds are almost
unaffected by the fan at a height of 0.5 to 0.7 m at the same location. In contrast, larger diameter fans
have a deeper spreading zone. For fans at or above 10 ft in diameter, the height of the spreading zone at
a distance of one fan diameter from the fan center is approximately the height of an average person.
However, large diameter fans have lower air speeds directly under the fan center, near the stagnation
point. As Figure 24 shows, the larger the ratio of fan diameter to room size is, the more uniform the
distribution of air speeds will be in the room.

**Figure 23  Example air speed distribution from a ceiling fan (Source: Gao, Y. et al., 2017)**

**Figure 24 Air speeds over distance from the fan center (Source: Raftery, P. et al., 2019)**

Whether this uniformity or variability is preferable, or whether neither is particularly relevant depends
highly on the type of space and how the occupants use that space. Even under identical environmental
conditions, occupant comfort needs vary significantly based on individual preference, clothing levels,
metabolic rates, and their thermal history. In many cases the variability in air speeds created by a ceiling
fan can help address these differences and overall improve occupant comfort. For example, in spaces
where occupants can easily move around, such as a lobby, gymnasium or event space, variability is likely
beneficial as the comfort needs of different occupants can be met by choosing their location in the space.
Similarly, in spaces where there is some existing spatial thermal non-uniformity due to an architectural
feature or varying activity levels in the space, targeting air movement accordingly may improve comfort.
For example, the thermal comfort impact of increased solar radiation near a poorly shaded, highly glazed
façade could be offset by locating ceiling fans near the façade. Other examples could be to locate ceiling
fans over the audience above a dance floor area, or in front of the stove in a kitchen.

In contrast, in spaces where the occupants cannot easily move around, particularly those where
occupants will be in those locations for extended periods, uniformity (or more granular control) is likely
beneficial because there is no way of guaranteeing that the person who feels the warmest happens to be
the one who is located where the air speeds are highest in the room. Examples here include a shared
office with assigned seating. There are also applications where neither uniformity or variability is
particularly relevant. For example, a private office where the single occupant has control over the fan
speed.

## Interaction with Lighting
Whenever possible, lighting design and ceiling fan layouts should be developed in coordination. While
many ceiling fans are available with built-in lighting, typical ceiling fan lights may be insufficient for many
applications. Most applications will be best served by a lighting system that is independent of, or in
addition to the ceiling fan(s).

The primary cause for concern when coordinating lighting systems and ceiling fans is the potential for a
flicker or strobing effect caused by the fan blades passing through the beam of light, or intersecting with
an occupant's line of sight to the light source. To avoid this, arrange ceiling fans and light fixtures so that
the bulk of the light distribution does not intersect with the sweep of the fan blades. Ideally, light fixtures
are suspended at the level of the fan blades or below them. Light fixtures should never be placed directly
above ceiling fan blades, and point source and downlight fixtures should be located so that the beam
angle does not intersect with the fan blades. More diffuse sources, such as fluorescent troffer-type
fixtures may be somewhat less susceptible to strobing effects from interaction with ceiling fans, but
placement should still be carefully considered in relation to ceiling fans.

Generally, any recessed ceiling fixtures and fixtures that emit light above the level of the fan blades
should be located as far as possible from the ceiling fan while still maintaining appropriately uniform light
levels. When working with uniform arrangements of recessed troffers in a ceiling grid, fans should be
roughly centered between four fixtures
