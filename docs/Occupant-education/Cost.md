# Cost
Like many building products, ceiling fan costs can vary widely depending on size, material, motor type,
and other characteristics. Standard ceiling fans can range from less than $100 for basic off-the-shelf
models to over $1,000 for more specialized fans with more decorative features, higher quality materials,
and/or automated onboard control systems. In general, fans with DC motors tend to be more expensive
than fans with AC motors, but DC motors also tend to be more energy efficient, quieter, and more
durable than AC motor fans due to better bearings and build quality. A wide range of high quality,
efficient standard fans with DC motors are currently available from $400 upwards. Large-diameter ceiling
fans start at approximately $3,000 and increase in cost with fan diameter and performance
characteristics. There is relatively little difference in performance between DC and AC motors for the
larger motor sizes associated with large-diameter fans.

Installation costs can vary widely depending on the fan (assembly time, weight and diameter), the space
conditions, and whether the installation is new construction or a retrofit. Very approximately, it can take
a professional anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours to assemble and install a single ceiling fan depending
on the selected model and site conditions. On the low end of that estimate, the time required to install a
ceiling fan is simply the labor cost to assemble the ceiling fan and connect it to an existing junction box.
On the other hand, a variety of factors can make ceiling fan installations more complicated, and therefore
more expensive. The need for additional structural bracing in spaces with suspended ceilings, the need
for additional people to handle and install larger fan models, running new wiring for power and controls
in retrofit scenarios, and the need for mechanical lifts for installations in spaces with high ceilings are just
a few of the factors that can add complication and cost for ceiling fan installations. In retrofit scenarios, if
there is already an electrical box in place, installation costs may be minimal, but if new wiring and
junction boxes are needed, the installation is likely to be more complicated and more costly.

As an example, for a recent research project which installed 99 fans in different sites throughout the
California Central Valley, retrofit installation costs (including permit costs) ranged from an average of
$427 per fan for installations in the residential demonstration units to $677 per fan for one of the
community buildings in the demonstration project with eight-foot suspended tile ceilings. These high
costs account for the relatively high costs of labor and permits in California, as well as site-specific
conditions that made the installations more complicated. Some of the fans in spaces with suspended
ceilings required additional bracing, and several of the residential applications required entirely new
wiring and electrical boxes which added to installation costs. Variations in these installation costs also
take into account external factors beyond the fan installation, such as long travel times to the
demonstration sites (several hours each way), and the size and efficiencies of each of the installation
projects (e.g., larger jobs had lower average per fan costs since external factors are averaged over a larger
number of fans).
