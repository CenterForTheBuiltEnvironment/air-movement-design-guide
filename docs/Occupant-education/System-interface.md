# System Interface

**Relocated from the original guide p47**

A key part of the success of any ceiling fan installation is ensuring that occupants understand the purpose
and use of the ceiling fans.

In cases with regular occupants (as opposed to spaces with transient occupants such as lobbies or event
spaces) who do not have direct control over the fan operation, occupants should be informed about the
purpose and operation of the ceiling fans. Ideally, spaces where occupants do not have direct control
over fan operation should also allow for flexibility so that occupants may find a location within the space
that best suits their comfort preferences.

In applications where occupants have access to fan controls, it is also helpful to post information or
instructions encouraging occupants to adjust ceiling fan settings when they are too warm, rather than
reducing thermostat setpoints. Two examples of occupant interface information plaques are provided in
the images below. Figure 36 shows a simple plaque with basic recommendations, while Figure 37 is an
example of more detailed user information.
