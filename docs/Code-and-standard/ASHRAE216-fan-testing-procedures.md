# ASHRAE 216 and Fan Testing Procedures
A new standard currently under development, ASHRAE Standard 216, “Methods of Test for Determining
Application Data of Overhead Circulator Fans”, is intended to provide standardized performance data for
the application of overhead circulation ceiling fans in indoor spaces. The room airspeed distribution test
results can be used to calculate occupant thermal comfort and to demonstrate compliance with the
thermal comfort requirements of ASHRAE Standard 55. This standard includes requirements for test
instrumentation, the features of test rooms features, and measurement procedures. It also includes
calculation procedures for a number of performance metrics relevant to thermal comfort application of
overhead circulator ceiling fans such as uniformity, room average cooling effect, heating draft risk, and
comfort cooling efficacy.

Once adopted, this standard will provide a consistent, industry-standard practice for determining ceiling
fan performance characteristics. Manufacturers will be able to use Standard 216 test procedures to test
their products and provide standardized performance data for use in specification and simulation of fan
performance. Standard 216 test procedures should also be used for any full scale fan test mock-ups. In
conjunction with the proposed Addendum C to ASHRAE Standard 55 (described above), this new standard
will support the implementation of ceiling fans as thermal comfort features in buildings.

As of this writing, the proposed Standard 216 is still in draft form pending final adoption.
