# Fire Code Requirements

The primary concern with ceiling fans in relation to the fire code is the interaction with fire sprinklers.  For
the most part, standard ceiling fans in typical residential and nonresidential applications have few
limitations in relation to fire sprinklers, while large-diameter ceiling fans require a higher degree of
integration with fire suppression systems.

The California Fire Code (Title 24, Part 9) cites the requirements of the National Fire Protection
Association’s NFPA 13, “Standards for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems,” and NFPA 13R, “Standard for
the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in Low-Rise Residential Occupancies,” to govern the use of fire
sprinklers in buildings.

Per NFPA 13 in most nonresidential applications, for ceiling fans less than 60 inches (1.5m) in diameter
where the blades are less than 50% of the swept area in plan view, fire sprinklers can be located without
regard to the fan blades. Since the above requirement specifically calls out “fan blades,” there may be
cases where other parts of the ceiling fan, such as motor housing or mounting pendants (or fan blades
that are less than 50% open in plan view), are considered obstructions to fire sprinklers. In most cases,
for any motor housing, mounting pendant, or other part of the fan that is 18” or less below the level of
the sprinkler deflector, the so-called “rule of three” applies, where sprinklers must be placed away from
the obstruction a minimum distance of three times the maximum dimension of the obstruction, up to
24”. In other words, if the motor housing of a ceiling fan is 7” in diameter, any fire sprinklers should be
located at least 21” from the motor housing. In the 2019 version of NFPA 13, for extended coverage
sprinklers and residential sprinklers, this requirement is increased to a distance of four times the
maximum dimension of the obstruction, up to 36”.

For low-rise residential applications, NFPA 13R requirements are more explicit about sprinkler locations in
relation to obstructions such as ceiling fans. In these cases, the standards require pendant sprinklers to
be a minimum of 3 feet from any ceiling fan, and sidewall sprinklers to be at least 5 feet from any ceiling fan. 
Though the standards do not explicitly state where those distances are measured from, this is
typically interpreted at being the distance from the center point of the ceiling fan.
For larger format fans, NFPA 13 lays out more detailed requirements as follows:

- Fans must be no more than 24 feet in diameter
- Each fan must be approximately centered between four adjacent sprinklers
- The vertical distance from fan blade to sprinkler deflector must be at least 3 feet
- All fans must be interlocked to shut down immediately upon receiving a waterflow signal from
the alarm system in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 72

While this section covers requirements as they apply in the California Fire Code, adapted from NFPA
Standards, specific requirements may vary by local jurisdiction. Always consult local codes for
requirements for a specific project.
