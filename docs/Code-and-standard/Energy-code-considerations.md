# Energy Code Considerations
As of this writing, only Florida and Hawaii have energy code requirements for ceiling fans, as part of the
“Tropical Zone” options of their Residential Building Codes. In both states, this option requires that no
more half of the occupied area is air conditioned, the occupied space is not heated, renewable energy for
at least 80% of the service water heating load, operable fenestration, and ceiling fans or ceiling fan rough-ins 
in every bedroom and in the largest non-bedroom space, among other requirements.

To date, ceiling fans have not been included in the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Title
24, Part 6) as a compliance option for thermal comfort control. Although ASHRAE Standard 90.1 has
some options for increasing assumed cooling setpoints in conjunction with strategies such as ceiling fans,
this strategy has not yet been included in the California Energy Standards. There have been previous
proposals for Codes and Standards Enhancement (CASE) studies to develop options for residential
comfort using unconventional strategies in some coastal climate zones in California. These proposals use
cooling load avoidance strategies as a first priority, including passive solar strategies, advanced envelopes,
and night cooling, supplemented by non-compressor-based cooling strategies, such as evaporative
cooling or ceiling fans, when needed. This proposal was most recently presented as part of the 2013
Standards development process but has never been pursued by the CEC or the California investor-owned
utilities.

Although these strategies proposed for residential comfort remain viable, there are several barriers to
adoption in the Energy Efficiency Standards. One of the primary barriers has been a lack of widely
accepted standards for measuring cooling effect from these unconventional strategies such as ceiling
fans. Without accepted methods for modeling the cooling load avoidance, or measuring the cooling
effect of these strategies, there has been no reliable method for determining the potential energy savings
or cost effectiveness in accordance with standard CASE proposal procedures.

However, the development of new standards such as ASHRAE Standard 216, and updates to existing
standards such as the proposed addendum to ASHRAE Standard 55, described in the sections above, will
help to address this barrier. With the development of industry standards for measuring performance
characteristics of ceiling fans (ASHRAE 216) and defining the use of ceiling fans as a potential thermal
comfort control strategy (proposed addendum to ASHRAE 55), California has new resources to cite in
developing cooling comfort models for ceiling fans. These new standards re-open the opportunity to
develop comfort compliance options for the less used cooling strategies, such as ceiling fans, in future
revisions to the Energy Efficiency Standards.
