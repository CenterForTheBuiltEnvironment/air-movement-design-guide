# Seismic Requirements
In many applications, standard ceiling fans attached directly to a structural ceiling do not require any
further seismic bracing or restraint. However, applications with large-diameter ceiling fans, suspended
ceilings, long suspension rods, or other special conditions may require additional seismic support.

Seismic considerations and requirements are especially relevant for installations of ceiling fans in
California. Per the California Building Code, nonstructural components that are permanently attached the
structure, such as ceiling fans, must be installed to resist the effects of earthquake motions in accordance
with the ASCE 7 standard (from the American Society of Civil Engineers). The exact requirements in
ASCE 7 will vary depending on the size, weight, and configuration of the fan, the strength of the expected
seismic forces for the area, and the building type where it is installed.

In addition to the specific requirements in ASCE 7, there are some general best practices for all
applications and scenarios. The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) document, “Reducing
the Risks of Nonstructural Earthquake Damage – A Practical Guide” recommends that all suspended
fixtures, such as lighting and ceiling fans, have positive attachment to the structure to avoid falling
hazards. Ceiling fans should never be supported on a suspended ceiling grid or ceiling tile. In addition,
the California Department of the State Architect (DSA) has issued code interpretations pertaining to
suspended fixtures such as ceiling fans, stating that fixtures with rigid suspension pendants must be
attached to the structure using a device allowing movement in any direction (i.e., a ball and socket joint), 
and requiring bracing where any pendant fixture passes through a suspended ceiling. Some
manufacturers, such as Big Ass Fans, also suggest lateral restraint using guy wires that are at least ¼ inch
(6.35 mm) in diameter for large-diameter fans.

As always, consult local building codes to determine specific requirements.
