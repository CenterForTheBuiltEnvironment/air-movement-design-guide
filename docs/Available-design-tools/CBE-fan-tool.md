# CBE Ceiling Fan Design Tool
To help determine optimal ceiling fan arrangements, CBE developed an online [Ceiling Fan Design Tool](https://centerforthebuiltenvironment.github.io/fan-tool/).
The tool allows users to input room dimensions, design air speed ranges, and other parameters to
determine optimal ceiling fan placement. The tool includes characteristics for a range of default ceiling
fan options, or users can input specific details of other ceiling fan models to determine appropriate
layouts. In addition to providing recommended fan layouts, the tool provides estimate for airspeeds
(minimum, average, and maximum), cooling effect (minimum and maximum), and airspeed uniformity for
each proposed layout, as shown below in Figure 41. The tool also provides visualizations for the overall
ceiling fan plan for the space, as well as ceiling fan “cell” plan and section showing details on airspeeds
within each fan cell, and ideal mounting heights, as shown in Figure 42 and Figure 43.

The CBE Ceiling Fan Design Tool takes into account many of the design factors discussed in the sections
above. For more details on how the tool functions, please consult the online User Guide.
