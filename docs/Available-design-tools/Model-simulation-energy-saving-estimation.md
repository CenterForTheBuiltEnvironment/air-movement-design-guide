# Modelling, Simulation, and Energy Saving Estimation
To demonstrate the energy savings potential of ceiling fans in a whole building energy model, simply
increase the cooling setpoint based on the estimated cooling effect for the considered scenario, while
maintaining the same heating setpoint. Models will generally show approximately 10% reduction in total
HVAC savings per °C increase in cooling setpoint (5% per °F), through a combination of cooling and
associated transport energy savings (e.g. fan), as well as heating energy savings. The reason for heating
energy savings is that when the cooling setpoint is higher, temperatures in the space tend to be warmer
during the day than without ceiling fans, and this reduces morning warmup (and sometimes reheat)
energy consumption. For rapid estimates, the CBE Setpoint Savings Calculator will estimate the energy
savings for a particular location in the USA for a commercial office building based on EnergyPlus models.
