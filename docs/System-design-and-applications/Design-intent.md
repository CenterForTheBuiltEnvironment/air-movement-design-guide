# Design Intent (modify)

Ceiling fans are effective for comfort cooling and air circulation in nearly all scenarios and applications.
The flow chart in Figure 25 below gives a quick guide through the different issues to consider regarding
the air speed distribution in the space.

**Figure 25: Flow chart of air speed and distribution considerations**

Below outlines some key considerations for ceiling fan applications based on the design intent for
each space. These design intents are roughly sub-divided into four types, namely Single occupant, Uniformity, 
Variability, and Targeted. 

**(maybe we need to think of a better visualization method)**

## Single Occupant
Provide ceiling fan cooling directly to the occupant, taking into consideration
furniture configuration / space layout, locate fan directly above occupant where possible.

### Application examples
<ul><li>Office-Private</li></ul>
<ul><li>Residential</li></ul>

### Target maximum air speed
 High to very high

### Comments
<ul><li>Provide local manual control</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ensure fan is capable of turning down to a low fan air speed</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ceiling fan locations should consider potential/planned furniture locations</li></ul>

## Uniformity
For multi-occupant spaces where locations are fixed or inflexible, maximize uniformity
and coverage at relatively low air speeds throughout the occupied subzones of the
space to ensure consistent experience for all occupants.

### Application examples
<ul><li>Assembly / Event Spaces – Fixed</li></ul>
<ul><li>Classrooms and conference rooms (See Figure 13)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Dining Areas</li></ul>
<ul><li>Office - Shared, Assigned Seating (See Figure 1)</li></ul>
<ul>Retail</ul>

### Target maximum air speed
 Low to medium

### Comments
<ul><li>Prioritize uniformity and coverage to provide consistent conditions
throughout the occupied subzones of the space</li></ul>
<ul><li>For offices and classroom spaces, ensure maximum design air speed will not blow
papers off desks (approx. 150 fpm, can be as low as 80 for lightweight paper)</li></ul>
<ul><li>For dining and retail, separate airspeeds for subzones containing diners versus
servers, or clerks versus shoppers, may be created to account for their different
activity levels and cooling needs. (see targeted category below)</li></ul>

## Variability
For spaces where occupants have the flexibility to move around the space and
choose their preferred conditions, allow variable air speed conditions within the
space, up to medium air speeds. Uniformity is a lower priority.

### Application examples
<ul><li>Assembly / Event Spaces – Flexible</li></ul>
<ul><li>Cafeterias (See Figure 39: DPR Construction, Sacramento Office.
(Architecture: SmithGroup, Photo: copyright Chad Davies))</li></ul>
<ul><li>DGymnasium / Exercise Areas (See Figure 38)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Office - Shared, Hoteling / Unassigned </li></ul>

### Target maximum air speed
 Medium

### Comments
<ul><li>For office spaces, ensure maximum design air speed will not blow papers around.</li></ul>

## Targeted
For spaces with inconsistent or transient occupancies, inconsistent thermal
conditions, and/or spaces with specific thermal requirements, target ceiling fan
strategies to the specific needs of the space.

Consider providing different air speed conditions for different occupant types.
For example, permanent occupants in a space (e.g., receptionists in a lobby) may
have different thermal comfort requirements than temporary occupants
who are passing through the space. Similarly, fans can be used to address
inconsistent thermal conditions in a space, such as areas of high solar heat gain near
windows, or areas where occupants can be expected to have notably different metabolic rates.

### Application examples
<ul><li>Assembly / Event Spaces – Transitional</li></ul>
<ul><li>Lobbies</li></ul>
<ul><li>Agricultural / Livestock</li></ul>
<ul><li>Industrial Production / Manufacturing</li></ul>
<ul><li>Kitchens (commercial)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Outdoor</li></ul>
<ul><li>Gymnasium / Exercise Areas – directly over areas or equipment
where occupants likely will have high metabolic rates</li></ul>

### Target maximum air speed
Low to high; depending on application and occupancy, target may vary
throughout the space

### Comments
<ul><li>Allow flexibility or ensure lower air speeds for any permanent occupants in
the space (receptionists, etc.)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Maximum target air speeds in agricultural, industrial, and warehouse
applications will depend on whether the space has other mechanical cooling
(unconditioned spaces may require higher maximum air speeds)</li></ul>
