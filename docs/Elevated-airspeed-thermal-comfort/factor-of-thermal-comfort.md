# Factor of Thermal Comfort

ASHRAE Standard 55 â€“ Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy identifies six factors that
affect thermal comfort:

## Metabolic Rate 
The rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work,
based on the level of activity. For example, the body generates more heat while walking than
while sitting still.
## Clothing Insulation 
The insulating effect of clothing preventing heat loss from the body. For
example, shorts and a short-sleeve shirt will allow more heat loss from the body than pants and a
heavy sweater.
## Air Temperature
The temperature of air at a certain point. 
## Mean Radiant Temperature
The average temperature of the surfaces surrounding a certain point, weighted by how large an angle that 
surface makes when viewed from that point.
## Air Velocity or Speed
The velocity or speed of air at a certain point.
## Humidity
How much moisture the air contains.
