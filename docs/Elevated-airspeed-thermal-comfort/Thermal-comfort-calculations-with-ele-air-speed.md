# Thermal Comfort Calculations With Elevated Air Speed

Standard 55 also provides a method called The Elevated Air Speed Comfort (Section 5.3.3. of standard) to
calculate thermal comfort in situations of elevated airspeed. This method uses a combination of the
Analytical Comfort Zone Method combined with the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) method
(Normative Appendix D of standard). Since increasing air speeds has a cooling effect, the method
calculates adjusted air and radiant temperatures according to how occupants are expected to feel under
increased air speed conditions to calculate a new PMV value. The “Standard Effective Temperature” (SET)
output translates the 6 thermal comfort factors (from above) into a single temperature equivalent. The
SET provides a single metric that can be compared across a variety of comfort conditions.
Cooling effect is also used to calculate the Cooling Fan Efficiency (CFE). CFE is defined in ASHRAE Standard
216, currently under development, as the ratio of the cooling effect to the input power of the fan. CFE
gives people a standardized way to compare how much cooling a fan provides when consuming the same
amount of energy.
