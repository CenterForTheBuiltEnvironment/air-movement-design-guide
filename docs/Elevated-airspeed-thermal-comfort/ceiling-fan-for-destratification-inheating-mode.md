# Ceiling Fans For Destratification In Heating Mode

In addition to directly cooling occupants, ceiling fans also effectively mix the air in a space, which has
several applications. The most common of these applications is where the temperatures in a space are
stratified, with much warmer air close to the ceiling and cooler air near the floor. This typically occurs in
spaces with high ceilings or where the heating equipment has a relatively high discharge temperature. In
these conditions, ceiling fans can mix the air in the space such that the temperature at the floor (and
close where the thermostat is located) is close to the average temperature in the space. This can save
energy and also improve occupant comfort. Ceiling fans can run in either direction to achieve this mixing,
though they will use more power to achieve the same mixing effect when operating in reverse (moving air
upward) than forwards (moving air downward). Note that when destratifying, the space is typically
operating in heating mode and operating at the lower end of the range of temperatures that define the
thermal comfort zone. As such it is very important to maintain very low air speeds in the occupied zone in
order to avoid the sensation of draft. Depending on the specific conditions, the occupant locations, and
the minimum speed capabilities of the fan, running the fan in forward or reverse may be better able to
achieve this goal
