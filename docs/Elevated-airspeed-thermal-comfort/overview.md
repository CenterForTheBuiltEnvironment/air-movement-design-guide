# Overview

In this section we discuss the thermal comfort related effects of increased air movement using ceiling
fans for cooling applications. We also discuss tools such as the [CBE Thermal Comfort Tool](https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/) to help
determine the right air speed and other factors for optimal thermal comfort. Figure 6 shows the cooling
effect–or how many degrees warmer the air temperature can be to provide the same level of thermal
comfort–associated with increased air speeds. This figure also highlights that the design air speeds under
discussion in this guide are well below the air speeds that a person experiences every day. An example
design speed of 0.5 m/s or 100 fpm, equal to approximately 2 °C or 4 °F cooling effect, is approximately
half the air speed that a person experiences just from the relative motion of walking slowly through still air conditions.
