# ASHRAE Standard 55 Thermal Environmental Conditions For Human Occupancy

ASHRAE Standard 55 – Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy identifies factors
(discussed above) that may affect thermal comfort in an indoor environment and how occupant
satisfaction is affected when these factors are changed. The standard also provides methods to
determine optimal values for each of the factors to create a comfortable environment.

Standard 55 outlines both a graphical and analytical method to determine acceptable thermal comfort
zones. In the graphical comfort zone method (Section 5.3.1 of the standard), comfort zones are shown on
a graph based on occupant metabolic rates and clothing insulation levels. By using space conditions, such
as temperature and humidity, it can be determined whether the space falls within the occupants’ comfort
zone. This method can only be used however when the occupants’ metabolic rates and clothing insulation
levels are within a certain range and does not account for changes in comfort zone due to elevated air
speed.

The analytical comfort zone method (Normative Appendix B) can be used for a wider range of occupant
characteristics. The analytical comfort method calculates a predicted mean vote (PMV) based on a
combination of thermal comfort factors. PMV is an index that predicts the average vote of thermal
sensation in a large group of people on scale from –3 (cold) to 3 (hot), where a score of 0 would be
considered perfectly comfortable. Using this method, a PMV between –0.5 and 0.5 must be obtained to
be ASHRAE 55 compliant.

ASHRAE 55-2017 Addendum C introduces comfort control classification levels (CCCLs) into the standard,
where a lower CCCL number indicates an improved level of occupant comfort. This captures the
beneficial effects of increased opportunities for local and group level control of thermal comfort.

#### ASHRAE 55-2017 Addendum C comfort control classification levels (CCCLs)
| CCCL | Required Control Measure(s) | Informative Examples Meeting CCCL |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Personal control of two or more |  <ul><li>Private office with a ceiling fan and an occupant adjustable thermostat</li><li>Shared office with desktop fans and seat warmers for each occupant</li></ul> |
| 2 | Personal control of one |  <ul><li>Private office with an occupant adjustable thermostat</li><li>Shared office with a desktop fan for each occupant</li></ul> |
| 3 | Multi occupant control of two or more | <ul><li>Shared office with an occupant adjustable thermostat and ceiling fan control</li></ul> |
| 4 | Multi occupant control of one |<ul><li>Shared office with an occupant adjustable thermostat</li></ul> |
| 5 | No occupant control |<ul><li>Shared or private office with an un-adjustable thermostat or no thermostat</li></ul> |
