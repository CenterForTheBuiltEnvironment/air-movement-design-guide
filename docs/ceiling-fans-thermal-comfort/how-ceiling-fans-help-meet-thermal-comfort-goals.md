# How Ceiling Fans Help Meet Thermal Comfort Goals

Ceiling fans increase air speed, and increased air speed accelerates two of the heat transfer mechanisms
described above: convection and evaporation. Thus, ceiling fans accelerate heat loss from the body,
providing a cooling sensation. The cooling sensation from increased air speed allows the body to maintain
thermal comfort at higher air temperatures than what would be comfortable in still air.

In addition to providing comfort at increased temperatures, ceiling fans are capable of providing
instantaneous comfort effects that thermostat adjustments cannot. A thermostat and HVAC system that
conditions the whole room generally takes 15 minutes or longer before the occupant will perceive a
change in their thermal environment. However, a ceiling fan has an almost instantaneous effect. If an
occupant feels too warm, turning on or increasing the speed of a ceiling fan instantly provides a cooling
sensation. Similarly, if an occupant is too cool and the fan is operating, reducing the ceiling fan speed or
turning it off instantly provides a warmer sensation. Ceiling fans are also ideally suited to providing
adaptive or transitional comfort for changing human comfort conditions. Adjusting ceiling fan speeds can
help accommodate the natural fluctuations in body temperature and comfort preferences throughout
the day. Similarly, the adjustable nature of ceiling fans can provide enhanced thermal comfort during
transitional moments, such as the changing comfort needs when transitioning from an active metabolic
rate event (for example, after walking from a meeting in a different part of the building, or arriving in to
work from a morning commute) to a resting metabolic rate (such as sitting at a desk in an office), or
simply due to different personal thermal comfort requirements of occupants in the same physical space.

In order to determine how much air movement is needed for thermal comfort and occupant satisfaction,
we can look at ASHRAE Standard 55 and the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool.
