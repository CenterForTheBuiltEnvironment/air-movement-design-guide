# Human Body Thermoregulation

As discussed above, thermal comfort is an occupant’s satisfaction (“comfort”) with the perceived
temperature (“thermal”) of their environment. This satisfaction depends on how much heat is released or
retained by the occupant’s body. Heat transfer to and from the body occurs in four ways. These are listed
in order of decreasing amount of heat transfer under standard conditions:

## Radiation 
Heat transfer via electromagnetic waves between objects that are not touching. The
most familiar form of radiant heat transfer is the radiant energy from the sun. However, ongwave radiation to surrounding surfaces is also a primary mechanism of heat loss from the
  human body. 
## Convection 
Heat transfer between a solid source and a fluid, in this case between skin and air, is
  of similar magnitude to heat transfer by radiation under standard conditions (still air). The
  amount of heat loss from the body through convection depends on the air speed, as that directly
  affects the convective heat transfer rate from the skin. Still air acts like an insulator, with
  convection only occurring due to the buoyancy driven effect driven by the temperature
  difference between skin (or clothes) and the surrounding air. As air speed increases, this gives
  rise to forced convection, allowing for more heat to be released. 
## Evaporation
Heat loss through the phase change of sweat from liquid to vapor. The phase
  change requires energy in the form of heat extracted from the skin, cooling the body when sweat
  evaporates. The rate of evaporation depends on the humidity of the surrounding air, with drier
  air able to absorb more moisture through evaporation. 
## Conduction
Heat transfer between objects in contact. The cooling sensation of holding a cold
  drink or the warming sensation of touching a hot surface are both examples of heat transfer
  through conduction. Conduction is typically responsible for the smallest share of heat loss from
  the body.
