# CBE Thermal Comfort Tool

A helpful tool to find comfort zones at elevated air speeds according to ASHRAE 55 methodology is the
[CBE Thermal Comfort Tool](https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/), an online tool developed by The Center for the Built Environment at the
University of California at Berkeley.

The user enters temperature, air speed, humidity, metabolic rate and clothing level into the tool to
calculate results including PMV, SET, and ASHRAE 55 compliance as well as generating the graph below in
Figure 8. The blue shaded area represents the ASHRAE 55 compliant comfort zone while the red mark
shows where the user inputs are relative to the comfort zone. The tool also supports the international
comfort standard ISO EN 16798.

The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool also takes into account elevated air speeds. As the air speeds increase, the
range of acceptable temperatures increases, and the blue shaded area shifts to the right. Using higher air
speeds allows the user to be ASHRAE 55 compliant at higher cooling temperature setpoints. Note that
Standard 55 has a maximum average air speed permitted in the case that occupants do not have control
over the system (0.8 m/s or 160 fpm). This can be specified as an input in the Thermal Comfort Tool as
well. To support this functionality, users can also select the “air speed vs. operative air temperature”
mode from the drop down menu above the chart to view the comfort range and results in terms of air
speed and temperature, as shown in Figure 9, below
