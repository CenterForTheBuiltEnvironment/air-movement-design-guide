# About this design guide

This guide enables architects, designers, and engineers to maximize the many benefits of integrating
ceiling fans into building systems. It introduces the advantages of using ceiling fans, describes how ceiling
fans work, provides guidance and resources for designing spaces with ceiling fans and specifying ceiling
fan products.

## Benefits Of Ceiling Fans

Ceiling fans are more than just a basic amenity for residential applications. Increasingly, ceiling fans are
found in applications varying from industrial and warehouse applications to offices and high-end
hospitality settings, and everything in between.
The extensive use of ceiling fans in residential applications (over 80% of single family homes in the United
States have at least one ceiling fan), as demonstrated in Figure 3 below, indicates their effectiveness in
supporting thermal comfort, and occupant demand for controllable air movement.

This widespread applicability stems from the many benefits that ceiling fans can provide in interior
environments.
The key benefits of ceiling fans are as follows:
* Thermal Comfort
* Improved Air Distribution
* Improved Perceived Air Quality
* HVAC First Cost Savings
* Energy Savings
The following subsections describe each of these benefits in more detail.

### Thermal Comfort
Simply stated, thermal comfort is an occupant’s satisfaction (“comfort”) with the perceived temperature
(“thermal sensation”) of their environment. For centuries, humans have been using fans to help regulate thermal comfort. The reason for this is simple: in warm conditions there is generally less heat lost from
the skin than in cooler conditions, and so people are at risk of warming up (the science of thermal
comfort is described in more detail below). Increased air movement across the skin carries away more
heat from the body (via convection and evaporation), and thereby restores comfort. Since the advent of
mechanical HVAC systems, building designers have largely focused on a single factor of thermal comfort:
air temperature. However, modifying other factors of thermal comfort, such as air speed, changes how a
particular air temperature is perceived. Occupants near a ceiling fan will feel cooler than they would at
the same temperature in still air, similar to the phenomenon of “wind chill”, though the wind chill index is
typically used for higher air speeds and colder temperatures than occur indoors. Similarly, when the air
temperature is warmer, occupants near a fan will feel more comfortable than they would in still air
conditions.

### Improved Air Distribution
In addition to the thermal comfort benefits of increased air speeds, ceiling fans can also improve air
distribution, working in concert with the HVAC system to provide the desired thermal conditions more
consistently throughout a space. When correctly designed and operated, ceiling fans support the HVAC
system to minimize temperature gradients within a space, providing more consistent temperature and air
quality conditions throughout a space. This improved air distribution can be effective for both heating
and cooling scenarios. For example, ASHRAE Standard 62.1 – Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality
lists a ventilation effectiveness of 0.8 for ceiling-supplied warm air systems (due to stratification of the
warm air near the ceiling), but adding ceiling fans in this scenario brings the ventilation effectiveness back
to 1.0, or fully mixed condition, reducing the amount of outside air required.

### Improved Air Quality
By increasing air movement and improving air distribution in a space, ceiling fans also improve air quality.
The increased air movement prevents the sensation of stale or stuffy air, and can help dissipate odors.
One recent study has also documented a measurable air quality improvement from ceiling fans by
dissipating CO2 and other exhaled pollutants that would otherwise gather near occupants in still air
conditions. Large-scale studies of occupant survey data indicate that occupants would prefer more air
movement than they have, especially in conditions where occupants report feeling warm, as illustrated in
Figure 4.

### First Cost Savings
The benefits described above—thermal comfort, improved air distribution, and improved air quality—
achieve more than just increased occupant satisfaction, they can also help reduce first costs for HVAC
systems. Using ceiling fans to more effectively distribute air throughout a space can reduce the extent of
distribution ductwork and diffusers required to serve a zone. Additionally, if the same zone is designed to
a slightly higher cooling setpoint due to the comfort cooling effect provided by the fans, this can also
reduce the required latent and sensible cooling capacity of the HVAC system, providing first cost savings
to equipment and ductwork.

### Energy Savings
Perhaps most importantly, when implemented effectively as an integral component of a building’s
thermal comfort strategy, ceiling fans can also result in significant energy savings by reducing the demand
on the HVAC system. Although ceiling fans consume energy, the potential HVAC savings outweighs fan
energy use, typically by a factor ranging between 10 and 100 times. The primary energy saving derives
from thermal comfort benefits of ceiling fans, keeping occupants comfortable at higher temperatures and
allowing for increased cooling setpoints. Effectively, a room with ceiling fans is thermally comfortable
over a wider range of temperatures than a room without ceiling fans. This wider range of temperatures
reduces the cooling and fan energy consumption of the HVAC system. Counterintuitively, this wider range
of temperatures also reduces heating energy consumption because when a space is warmer, it will take
longer to cool down to the heating setpoint. Lastly, when ceiling fans are used to provide air distribution, reducing the extent of distribution ductwork and diffusers, they also help reduce HVAC fan energy by
reducing the pressure drop in the air system. The section on Modelling, Simulation and Estimating Energy
Savings discusses these effects in more.

### History
Methods of increasing air speeds to produce a cooling effect have been in use for centuries, from the
most rudimentary handheld fans to more elaborate systems of sail-like fabric sheets or wooden panels
mounted to ceilings. Ceiling-mounted “punkah” fans, like those shown in Figure 5, were common in
places like colonial India and the Antebellum South in the US, and were manually operated with ropes
pulled by servants or enslaved people. For a more localized cooling effect, there were also fan chairs like
the one used by George Washington, as shown in Figure 5.
