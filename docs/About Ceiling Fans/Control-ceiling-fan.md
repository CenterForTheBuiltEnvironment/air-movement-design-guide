# Control
Controls for ceiling fans run the gamut from basic manual on-off and speed controls, to fully automated
onboard controls that are also integrated with the building automation system. In any scenario the design
and specification of ceiling fans must address a variety of controls considerations. Will the fans be fully
manual or automated? Will occupants have control over the fans, and if so how and where? If the fans
are automatically controlled, what will the setpoints or triggers be? How much variation in fan speeds is
necessary for the application? How will ceiling fan controls interface with the HVAC system? These
questions must all be considered when planning controls for ceiling fans.

Control needs and priorities will vary from application to application. The following sections provide
guidance through the most common decisions related to controls when designing and specifying ceiling
fans.

## User Interface
One of the most important control considerations for implementing ceiling fans is how the occupants will
control the fans. Typical user interface options are listed below. Note that it is common for ceiling fan
installations to combine several of the control types listed below in a single application.

### Pull Chain

### Wired Wall Control

### Wireless IR Remote Control or Detachable Wall Control (modify)

### Thermostatic (new)

### Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Connectivity via Phone Apps or Internet

### Building Automation System Interface

## Types of Control Automation 

### Manual

### Schedule

### Automation Based on Occupancy

### Temperature Sensing

### Learning Behaviours and/or Preference

## Additional Considerations for Choosing a Control Type

### Amperage Restrictions
