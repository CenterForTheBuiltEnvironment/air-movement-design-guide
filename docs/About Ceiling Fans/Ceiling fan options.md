# Ceiling fan options

The following sections describe the different types of ceiling fans, and the features that differentiate ceiling fan models.

## Fan types
A part of the "Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Ceiling Fans" the US Department of Energy (DOE) defines a variety of ceiling fans types. For the purpose of this guide,
discussions focus on two main ceiling fan types:

### Standard Ceiling Fan
Any ceiling fan with a diameter greater than 18 inches but no more than 7 feet, and
with the lowest point of the fan blades more than 10 inches below the ceiling. A standard ceiling fan not
exceed the limits outlined in Table 2 below.

### Large-diameter Ceiling Fan
any ceiling fan that is greater than seven feet in diameter. These are often also
known as High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) fans.

In addition to these two primary types of ceiling fans, the DOE defines several other fan types that are
commonly used, many of which fall under the category of small-diameter ceiling fan.

### Small-diameter Ceiling Fan
Any ceiling fan that is more than 18 inches in diameter but less than or equal to
seven feet in diameter, and with an airflow of at least 1,840 CFM and a rotational speed of more than 90
RPM at its highest speed

### High-speed Small-diameter Ceiling Fan
Any small-diameter ceiling fan that has a blade thickness
of less than 3.2 mm at the edge or a maximum tip speed greater than the applicable limit specified
in Table 2 below

### Low-speed Small-diameter Ceiling Fan
Any small-diameter ceiling fan that has a blade thickness
greater than or equal to 3.2 mm at the edge and a maximum tip speed less than or equal to the
applicable limit specified in Table 2 below. (“Standard ceiling fans”, defined above, are a type of
low-speed small-diameter ceiling fan.)

### Hugger Ceiling Fan
Any low-speed small-diameter ceiling fan for which the lowest point
on the fan blades is less than or equal to 10 inches from the ceiling

### Very-small-diameter Ceiling Fan
Any ceiling fan with one or more fan heads, each of which has a blade
span of 18 inches or less, and with an airflow of at least 1,840 CFM and a rotational speed of more than 90
RPM at its highest speed

### Highly-decorative Ceiling Fan
Any ceiling fan with a maximum rotational speed of 90 RPM and less than
1,840 CFM airflow at high speed

Note that while these DOE definitions include a variety of subcategories for small-diameter fans, any fan
larger than seven feet in diameter is simply a “large-diameter” fan, with no further differentiation.

#### Table 2: Ceiling Fan Blade and Tip Speed Criteria (Adapted from DOE Definitions)
| Airflow Direction | Thickness (t) of edges of blades, mm (inch) | Tip speed threshold, m/s (feet per minute) |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Downward-Only | 4.8 > t ⩾ 3.2 (3/16 > t ⩾ 1/8) | 16.3 (3200) |
| Downward-Only | t ⩾ 4.8 (t ⩾ 3/16) | 20.3 (4000) |
| Reversible | 4.8 > t ⩾ 3.2 (3/16 > t ⩾ 1/8) | 12.2 (2400) |
| Reversible | t ⩾ 4.8 (t ⩾ 3/16) | 16.3 (3200) |

As noted above, this guide is primarily focused on two main fan types, defined above as standard ceiling
fans and large-diameter ceiling fans. However, much of the discussion in this guide will also be relevant
to the other small-diameter ceiling fan types beyond the “standard” definition, and there is significant
overlap between many of the small-diameter ceiling fan subcategories. Note, for example, that “standard
ceiling fans” are a type of low-speed small-diameter ceiling fan, and “hugger ceiling fans” are essentially
equivalent to standard ceiling fans but with fan blades mounted closer to the ceiling (despite the negative
effect on efficiency) for suitability in spaces with lower ceiling heights.

In general, a larger diameter fan blade can move a larger volume of air than a smaller diameter fan blade.
As fan diameter increases, rotational speed is typically limited to prevent excessive noise from the fan
blades, especially near the blade tip. Additionally, where fans can be mounted at blade heights below 10
ft (i.e. almost all standard fans), rotational speed must be limited to meet safety criteria (see UL 507) for
the maximum speed of the blade tips. Large-diameter ceiling fans are sometimes referred to as “high
volume low speed” or HVLS fans. Because the design and shape of the fan blades can also have a
significant impact on airflow, as described in more detail below, the HVLS terminology is typically used to
describe large ceiling fans that are designed to prioritize performance in large commercial and industrial
spaces. For example, some large-diameter ceiling fans include “winglets” or blade tip fences (see
examples in Figure 11: Large-diameter ceiling fans at Barrie North School library. (Photo copyright Big Ass
Fans), Figure 38: High School Gymnasium, San Marcos, CA (Architecture: LPA Architect, Photo: copyright
Cris Costea), and Figure 40: Bluescope Buildings, North Carolina, USA (Photo: copyright Big Ass Fans)) to
maximize airflow and minimize noise, which is a less common problem in standard fans as the blade tip
speed is already constrained for safety reasons.

Though standard ceiling fans are often thought of in their residential applications, they are equally
effective for comfort cooling in most nonresidential applications (including offices, classrooms, gyms,
hospitality, etc.) where they can be positioned near the occupants. Large-diameter ceiling fans require
higher ceilings (typically at least 11 ft) and larger spaces free from obstructions to accommodate their
increased diameter. As a result, large-diameter ceiling fans are most often found in nonresidential
commercial and industrial applications.

Although the fan type definitions from the DOE are focused on fan diameter, in the case of specific fan
products there is some overlap in terms of applications and fan styles. Some large-diameter fans are
available in styles that are more frequently associated with standard fans, and some manufacturers have
HVLS fan models in diameters less than seven feet. Additionally, there are some large-diameter fans that
have a relatively low maximum rotational speed and thus, meet blade tip speed and thickness
requirements for mounting below 10 ft, though these also have a relatively low maximum airflow.

The DOE also defines a variety of other specialty ceiling fan types (including belt-driven ceiling fans,
centrifugal ceiling fans, multi-head ceiling fans, and oscillating ceiling fans), but those specialty types are
not the subject of this guide.

## Blade Types And Configuration
Blade shape, number of blades, and blade pitch are important factors in increasing energy efficiency
while maximizing air flow through the fan blades.

There are two main types of blades shapes shown in Figure 12 below. Blade shapes have evolved over
time from flat to airfoil-style blades to become more energy efficient and maximize air movement. As the
name implies, flat ceiling fan blades are flat panels mounted at a fixed angle, whereas airfoil blades are
similar to airplane wings in section. Similar to the cross-section of an aircraft wing, the curvature of the
airfoil blades helps increase air flow through the ceiling fan, minimizing air turbulence at the trailing edge
of the blade common to flat blades. Airfoil-style blades are thus typically more efficient and also quieter
than flat blades. However, flat blades are cheaper to manufacture. Note that flat blades will perform
equally whether the fan is operating in the forwards (blowing down) or reverse (blowing upwards)
direction. In contrast, airfoil blades will not operate as efficiently in reverse, and will typically have a lower
airflow when doing so. Some fan models have blades that can be manually attached in inverted position,
or can mechanically invert the blade while it is attached to the fan, which allows for improved efficiency
when operating in reverse.

### Flat Blade

### Airfoil Blade


The number of blades is an important factor in increasing airflow of ceiling fans. Although increasing the
number of blades will increase airflow, the increased weight and drag due to the blades can cause a loss
in energy efficiency. Standard fans typically have between 3 and 5 blades, though some models have as
few as 2 blades or up to 6 blades. Large-diameter fans typically have 6 or 8 blades, though some models
have as few as 3 blades.

Similarly, increasing the blade’s angle may also increase airflow at the cost of energy efficiency. Academic
modeling studies have found the optimal blade angle to be 8-10° for residential fans. Manufacturers
recommend 12-15°. Some airfoil-style blades also vary the blade angle over the length of the fan blade,
with steeper angles toward the center of the fan to maximize air flow for the low blade speed in this
region, and reducing to shallower angles toward the tips where the blade speed is high in order to limit
drag and maximize energy efficiency.

## Motor And Drive Types
There are three main types of motors used in ceiling fans: AC Induction, Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC),
and Brushless Direct Current (DC) motors. Generally, there are very large percentage efficiency savings
from moving from AC to DC motors for small fans, and far less of an effect for large diameter fans.

### AC Induction
<ul><li> How it works: Electromagnets on outside of motors (stator) creates a rotating magnetic field
causing motor rotation through induction.</li></ul> 
<ul><li> Benefits: Provides constant, even airflow and are cheaper than DC motors. </li></ul> 

### PMDC
<ul><li> How it works: Permanent magnets are located on the motor stator creating a stationary magnetic
field. A segmented commutator rotates within the magnetic field creating a mechanical switching
of current direction. </li></ul>
<ul><li> Benefits: More energy efficient than AC motors and provides constant force over a wider range of
speeds than AC motors. </li></ul>

### Brushless DC
<ul><li> How it works: Permanent magnets are rotated in motor creating a rotating magnetic field. Current
direction in the stator is switched in relation to the magnetic field to create rotation. </li></ul>
<ul><li> Benefits: Most energy efficient of the three motor types (for small motors on small diameter fans,
a DC motor often will use 70% less energy than an AC motor), most quiet, and has a longer service
life than PMDC motors.</li></ul>

Fans may also be either direct drive or gear-driven. Almost all small-diameter fans are direct drive, but
large-diameter ceiling fans may either be direct-drive or gear-driven.

Direct-drive fans are quieter than gear-driven fans, have a more refined appearance and have reduced
operating cost. However, direct-drive fans do provide less air flow and it may be harder to replace the
motors. Due to this, direct-drive fans are typically used in situations where sound level and aesthetics are
a concern and less airflow is needed.

On the other hand, gear-driven fans allow for higher motor power and are often used in situations where
maximizing airflow is a priority over sound levels or aesthetics. This is well suited for industrial settings
where ceilings are high and there is little or no air conditioning.
